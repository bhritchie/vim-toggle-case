*toggle-case.vim* - Cycle between standard variable case formats

A single command is provided by this plugin:

:ToggleCase

This command toggles the case of the variable under the cursor, cycling between:

- camelCase
- CamelCaseWithInitialCapital
- snake_case, and
- ALL_CAPS_SNAKE_CASE

For single-word variables, snake-case is left out of the cycle, since it would
be the same as camel-case. Leading underscores are always ignored.

By default :ToggleCase is bound to <leader>tt. You can override this by
defining your own mapping with a line such as this in your .vimrc:

nnoremap <leader>c :ToggleCase<cr>

The plugin can be disabled by adding the follwing line to your .vimrc and
restarting Vim:

let g:loaded_toggle_case = 1
